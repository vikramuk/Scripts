(SubSystemVerificationForNibpToneGeneration.story)
Narrative:
In order to perform subsystem verification for NIBP tone generation with independent volume control
As a Java  application, the appliation acts as a TCP client to send command to labview TCP server to process the audio/beep signals
signals, also acts as iMX and send commands to ACHC through audio control interface
I want to verify the processed  PWM signals from labview and the response from ACHC board
Scenario: Communicate with ACHC as iMX to initialize sequence number
Examples:
!-- Precondition:
!-- Interface should be opened to communicate with ACHC.
!-- Interface configuration is defined in 'ACHCConstants.java'. Refer DEFAULT_SERIAL_PORT.
Given we are connected to the audio control interface of the ACHC
When we send GET_PARAM_VOLUME {commandGetVolumeACHC} to get the NIBP volume from the ACHC
Then the ACHC should respond
!-- The above command is used to set the sequence number of the target to a known value

|commandGetVolumeACHC|
|85,55,06,FF,CF,07,00,00,00,CrcMsb,CrcLsb|

Example: {commandGetVolumeACHC=85,55,06,FF,CF,07,00,00,00,CrcMsb,CrcLsb}
!-- Precondition:
!-- Interface should be opened to communicate with ACHC.
!-- Interface configuration is defined in 'ACHCConstants.java'. Refer DEFAULT_SERIAL_PORT.
Given we are connected to the audio control interface of the ACHC

When we send GET_PARAM_VOLUME {commandGetVolumeACHC} to get the NIBP volume from the ACHC
Then the ACHC should respond
!-- The above command is used to set the sequence number of the target to a known value


Scenario: Communicate with ACHC as iMX to generate NIBP tone with independent volume control to analyze change in Volume and
 to simulate situations where the volume is increasing due to user action for beeps
Examples:
!-- Precondition:
!-- Interface should be opened to communicate with ACHC.
!-- Interface configuration is defined in 'ACHCConstants.java'. Refer DEFAULT_SERIAL_PORT.
!-- TCP/IP connection should be established between Java and LabView on Port 2000
Given we are connected to the audio control interface of the ACHC
And we are connected to the audio signal measurement system
And the audio signal measurement system is set up to detect NIBP beep {commandListenSignalsLabview}
When we send SET_PARAM_VOLUME command to ACHC to set the NIBP volume in increasing order using {commandSetVolumeACHC},
and verify the volume is updated internally in ACHC using GET_PARAM_VOLUME command, which is {commandGetVolumeACHC}, 
and generate a beep using GENERATE_BEEP {commandGenerategNibpBeep}
Then the ACHC should respond
And the audio signal measurement system should analyse the beep and respond
!-- No response packet from ACHC is expected in case of generate Beeps (as per protocol)
!-- Response of GET_PARAM_VOLUME is used to verify the volume is updated internally in ACHC when instructed to update volume using SET_PARAM_VOLUME
